# Welcome to Shri's Ecstacy
## I Write , Design & Build.
Hey, I am Shriyansh.

I won’t use those typical GPT-generated words like “enthusiast” or “passionate,” because I am what I am. I’m a human first—flawed, curious, building day by day. I’m hungry to learn more. And let’s keep it real—my learning curve isn’t lightning fast. I take my time to understand things deeply. But once I get it? I can build it. From scratch. From idea to execution.

My public repositories speak for themselves. I’ve put in work. Not perfect, not polished, but real. Each commit, each broken feature I fixed, each late night debugging a silly mistake—it's part of my journey. I don't try to appear like I know everything, because I don't. But I show up, I try, I improve. That’s what matters to me.

I’ve got a head full of ideas—startups, side projects, experiments. Some flop, some click, but all of them teach me something. I’ve worked on AI tools, dashboards, platforms, and systems that solve real problems. It may look scattered, but for me, it’s all exploration. I’m not trying to be some polished tech poster boy—I just want the space to learn, mess up, improve, and build with honesty. No buzzwords. Just real work. Just Shri.
